## init

Use the `init` command to initialize configuration and dependencies for a new project.

The `init` command installs dependencies, adds the `cn` util, configures `tailwind.config.cjs`, and CSS variables for the project.

```bash
npx solidui-cli@latest init
```

It also creates a `ui.config.json` file which houses all Solid UI configurations. Feel free to change where you would like your components to be stored by modifying the `componentDir` property.

## add

Use the `add` command to add components and dependencies to your project.

```bash
npx solidui-cli@latest add [component]
```

You will be presented with a list of components to choose from:
